# bitcoin-price-graphql-api

This application is a custom GraphQL API service built to mount a GraphiQL interface [Apollo graphql playground](https://www.apollographql.com/) on hitting the `/graphiql` endpoint in my [Bitcoin Exchange Calculator](https://github.com/ODINAKACHUKWU/bitcoin-exchange-calculator) application. This feature is enabled for Bitcoin Exchange Calculator application only on production.

Read the Bitcoin Exchange Calculator [README](https://github.com/ODINAKACHUKWU/bitcoin-exchange-calculator) and [Documentation](https://bitcoin-exchange-calculator.herokuapp.com/developer) for more details.
